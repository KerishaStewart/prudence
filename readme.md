# App Name: Prudence

Originating from the word "prudent," which is associated with wise decision-making and careful management of resources. This sends a strong message to users that the app will help them make informed choices to ensure their safety during a disaster.

# App Summary and Goals

This disaster readiness web app has been developed to aid the island of Nassau in the Bahamas during hurricane events. The app focuses on addressing human and social impacts by providing crucial information and facilitating communication between emergency responders and citizens in need.

Key Features:

# Future Work

- User authentication for role based data entry (Time did not permit to get this done)
For example: only a health care worker with a particular title/role will be allowed to add and update information for the hospital. The same can apply for the other agencies. The employee/ worker will only be allowed to add/ update information linked to the office in which they are employed and not the entire set of that agency, unless their role permits them to modify data from the entire set and not just a subset.

- A new graphical feature layer can be added to the map to give an overview of the health of vegetation of the land. This can be done at any time, before, during or after any occurrence of a disaster using NDVI indices and GPS coordinates.
